# EEG-Biometric-Recognition
A Biometric Person Recognition System based on Brainwave (EEG) signals, developed as part of an MSc Data Science dissertation.  
This project explores EEG-based biometrics for reliable individual identification using machine learning techniques and session-disjoint validation.

## üß© Project Overview
This repository implements a **biometric person recognition system** using **Electroencephalogram (EEG)** signals.  
The system extracts EEG-based spectral features (absolute and relative band power) and trains classifiers to identify individuals based on their brainwave patterns.

The project focuses on improving **cross-session generalization**, ensuring that the model performs well not only within a recording session but also across different days and recording sessions ‚Äî a critical factor for real-world biometric reliability.

## üéØ Objectives
- Develop a person identification system using EEG data.  
- Extract meaningful spectral features from EEG signals.  
- Evaluate traditional machine learning models (SVM, Random Forest).  
- Compare session-overlapping and session-independent evaluations.  
- Demonstrate robustness and generalization across EEG sessions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

### 1. **Preprocessing**
- Band-pass filtering and noise reduction.
- Data segmentation into **5-second overlapping windows**.
- Feature extraction from **19 EEG channels**.

### 2. **Feature Extraction**
- Absolute and relative band power across standard EEG bands:
  - Delta (0.5‚Äì4 Hz)
  - Theta (4‚Äì8 Hz)
  - Alpha (8‚Äì13 Hz)
  - Beta (13‚Äì30 Hz)
  - Gamma (30‚Äì50 Hz)

### 3. **Classification Models**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** with RBF kernel  
- **Random Forest Classifier**

### 4. **Evaluation Protocols**
Six evaluation strategies were implemented to measure generalization:
1. Random k-Fold Cross-Validation  
2. 60/20/20 Train-Validation-Test Split  
3. Cross-Validation by Session  
4. Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO)  
5. Hybrid Session-Subject Split  
6. Randomized-Label Control Test (sanity check)
